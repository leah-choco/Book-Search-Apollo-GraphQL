## Description:

This app was originally given to me as RESTful API app with more traditional routes and controllers. The goal was to remove those and use Apollo Provider/Server as well as GraphQl. In the app, you can search for books through a Google API and then save them in your profile. This utilizes mutations, queries, localStorage, and JWT(JSON web tokens) to help with authorization.

## Installation:

After cloning, it's an easy npm i in each appropriate folder. Specifically, I needed to add packages for apollo client in the front end and apollo-express-server in the back end. Graphql package was needed in both.

## Usage:

This app would be nice as a quick place to search and save books that you are interested in once deployed.
